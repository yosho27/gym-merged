Use keras-rl and OpenAI/gym to play the mobile game Merged - Joss Chapman

The main difference between my program and the one copied from github.com/keras-rl/keras-rl/blob/master/examples/dqn_cartpole.py is that I MADE MY OWN GYM. From scratch. I made the whole environment. It took all day, but most of that day was screwing with pips and stuff. And trying to deal with gym's HORRIBLE documentation. I mean, it fits on one page and doesn't even include all their classes! Anyways, I texted my mom asking for suggestions for single-player turn pased games (like 2048 or solitaire) sinc she loves that kind of game and she gave me some great suggestions (thanks mom!) including a mobile game called Merged. So I implemented that game in about 45 minutes and then spent the rest of the day making it compatible with keras-rl and trying to get the aforementioned pip installs to work. Anyways, it eventually worked and now I have an AI that plays Merged! (Also I changed the number of nodes and stuff but that seems less consequential)

To use, run test-gym-merged.py
As I said, I had to pip install a bunch of stuff on my laptop to make it work but I don't think you should.
I honestly don't know how many of these files are actually necessary but I just don't want to mess with anything at this point.
I think most of them were generated by cmd commands or something because I definitely didn't make them.
